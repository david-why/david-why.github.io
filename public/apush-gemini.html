             <p class="mb-2">The westward expansion of the United States in the 19th century was propelled by an inseparable synergy of profound economic ambitions and deeply ingrained ideological justifications. Economic interests provided the practical impetus and tangible rewards, while the ideology of Manifest Destiny shaped the national will, provided a unifying (though exclusionary) purpose, and offered a moral framework for continental conquest.</p>
             <p>This era was instrumental in forging a continental nation and fueling its economic ascent. However, this legacy is also marked by the methods of its achievement: the dispossession of Native American societies, severe environmental consequences, and the exacerbation of internal conflicts like slavery. Understanding these complex, intertwined motivations remains crucial for comprehending the historical trajectory and contemporary character of the United States.</p>
